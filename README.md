# Next.js 15 Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to navigation between pages.  When navigating from the `/about` page to the `/` (home) page, a brief flicker or unexpected rendering behavior might occur.  This issue seems to be linked to how Next.js handles component unmounting and remounting during client-side navigation.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Click the "Go Back Home" button.

Observe the brief flicker or rendering anomaly during the transition back to the home page. 

## Potential Solutions (Investigating)

We are currently exploring different solutions, including:

* Investigating potential issues related to the `useRouter` hook and its interaction with client-side navigation.
* Exploring strategies for optimizing component lifecycle methods to prevent unnecessary rendering.
* Considering alternative navigation approaches in Next.js 15.
